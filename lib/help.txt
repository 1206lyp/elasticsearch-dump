Usage: elasticdump --input [SOURCE] --output [DESTINATION] [OPTIONS]

--input
                    Source location (required)
--input-index
                    Source index and type
                    (default: all, example: index/type)

--output
                    Destination location (required)
--output-index
                    Destination index and type
                    (default: all, example: index/type)
--limit
                    How many objects to move in bulk per operation
                    limit is approximate for file streams
                    (default: 100)
--debug
                    Display the elasticsearch commands being used
                    (default: false)
--type
                    What are we exporting?
                    (default: data, options: [data, mapping, analyzer])
--delete
                    Delete documents one-by-one from the input as they are
                    moved.  Will not delete the source index
                    (default: false)
--searchBody
                    Preform a partial extract based on search results
                    (when ES is the input,
                      default: '{"query": { "match_all": {} } }')
--sourceOnly
                    Output only the json contained within the document _source
                      Normal: {"_index":"","_type":"","_id":"", "_source":{SOURCE}}
                      sourceOnly: {SOURCE}
                      default: false
--all
                    Load/store documents from ALL indexes
                    (default: false)
--bulk
                    Leverage elasticsearch Bulk API when writing documents
                    (default: false)
--ignore-errors
                    Will continue the read/write loop on write error
                    (default: false)
--scrollTime
                    Time the nodes will hold the requested search in order.
                    (default: 10m)
--maxSockets
                    How many simultaneous HTTP requests can we process make?
                    (default:
                      5 [node <= v0.10.x] /
                      Infinity [node >= v0.11.x] )
--bulk-use-output-index-name
                    Force use of destination index name (the actual output URL)
                    as destination while bulk writing to ES. Allows
                    leveraging Bulk API copying data inside the same
                    elasticsearch instance.
                    (default: false)
--timeout
                    Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for
                    a request to respond before aborting the request. Passed
                    directly to the request library. If used in bulk writing,
                    it will result in the entire batch not being written.
                    Mostly used when you don't care too much if you lose some
                    data when importing but rather have speed.
--skip
                    Integer containing the number of rows you wish to skip
                    ahead from the input transport.  When importing a large
                    index, things can go wrong, be it connectivity, crashes,
                    someone forgetting to `screen`, etc.  This allows you to
                    start the dump again from the last known line written (as
                    logged by the `offset` in the output).  Please be advised
                    that since no sorting is specified when the dump is
                    initially created, there's no real way to guarantee that
                    the skipped rows have already been written/parsed.  This is
                    more of an option for when you want to get most data as
                    possible in the index without concern for losing some rows
                    in the process, similar to the `timeout` option.
--inputTransport
                    Provide a custom js file to us as the input transport
--outputTransport
                    Provide a custom js file to us as the output transport
--toLog
                    When using a custom outputTransport, should log lines
                    be appended to the output stream?
                    (default: true, except for `$`)
